Problem - The problem is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on various input features. The goal is to create a model that can assist in assessing the quality of wines early in the production process, enabling winemakers to make informed decisions about improving the quality of their wines.

Result - The developed wine quality prediction model achieved promising results in accurately predicting the quality of wines. The model demonstrated high accuracy, precision, and recall in classifying wines into different quality categories. It effectively captured the relationships between input features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH levels, and residual sugar, and the corresponding wine quality.
