In this project, Leveraged AutoCAD and Catia V5 software to design and develop a cutting-edge 3D printed prosthetic hip implant, employing Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology.<br />
Also conducted surface modifcation research and application on prosthetic hip implants, successfully optimizing the fit, reducing friction, and extending the lifespan of the implants for enhanced patient outcomes
