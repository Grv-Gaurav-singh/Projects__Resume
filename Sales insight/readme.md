In this project, I helped AtliQ Hardware, a big computer hardware company in 
India, tackle a tricky issue. The sales director needed an easier way to 
understand and track sales because the company was growing fast. Imagine 
having lots of sales info but not knowing what it means – that's the problem i
solved.
First, I used special computer language (SQL) to look into the company's data 
and figure out things like the number of customers, types of products, and 
where they sold stuff. Then, I moved this data into a tool called Power BI to 
create a dashboard – a cool screen that shows important info in a simple way.
During this process, I fixed some issues with the data, like different currencies 
and unnecessary details. I also made sure the dashboard could be easily used 
by the sales director. The result? The dashboard displays crucial insights, 
including revenue, sales quantity, market-wise details, and trends. It enables 
quick decision-making, allowing the sales director to grasp the company's sales 
landscape effortlessly.
So, in a nutshell, I turned complicated data into a handy dashboard to help 
AtliQ Hardware make better decisions about their sales.
